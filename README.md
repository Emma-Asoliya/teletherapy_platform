##  The Story Behind UnMutedMinds

Mental health challenges among youth, especially in African communities, often go **unspoken** due to stigma, cost, or lack of access. UnMutedMinds was created to **break the silence**. It functions like a matchmaking platform — but instead of dates, we match **clients with therapists** based on needs, specializations, and availability.

The platform is centered on:
- **Anonymity where needed**
- **Simplicity and user empowerment**
- **Affordable and accessible teletherapy**
