            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>UnMutedMinds was born from the need to create a safe and expressive space, with the simple belief that healing starts from expression.
                After living a life like any other youth born in Africa, around the same time as me , I realized there needs to be a shift, that allows young people to express themselves.
                Our platform connects people young and old, across Africa to therapists, resources, and safe spaces across the world.
                We are here to help you find your voice, and remind you that sometimes breaking down is the first step to rising up.
            </p>
